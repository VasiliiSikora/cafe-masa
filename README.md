## Cafe Masa Coding challenge
This React application was created for the Cafe Masa challenge.

The application creates a simple website tabular display of data contained in the 'content/Guests.js' file.

Data can be filtered on users with the tag "Allow Marketing", and sorted on the 'Total Visits' and 'Total Spend' fields using
simple button toggles. 
### Building

    git clone https://github.com/alecfn/cafe-masa
    npm i
    npm start
    
The application will appear in a browser window with data displayed in the table.

Note: The application was tested in Chrome and Firefox. Other browsers may work, but are untested.
